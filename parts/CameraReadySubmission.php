    <b> Note: </b> The following instructions are adapted from ICC2019 Steering Committee.
    <br>

The deadline is August 1st, 2019. Failure to submit your Camera-Ready files by this date will result in your paper being not included in the proceeding. You may submit the final version of your paper by navigating <b> <a href="https://easychair.org/account/signin" target="_blank"> HERE </a> </b> and following the instructions.
<br>
    
Any changes you see fit to make to the final version of your paper as well as suggestions made by the reviewers should be incorporated in the camera-ready version. In addition, please be sure to do all of the following:<br>
&#9679;	Ensure that your paper conforms to the required format (see the Springer templates).
&#9679; Include the authors' names and affiliations under the title. Note that the list of authors should be identical to the list specified when submitting the paper.
&#9679; Ensure that your paper conforms to the appropriate submission types, 12-15 pages for long papers and 6-8 pages for short papers, including all tables, figures, and references.
&#9679; Ensure that all tables and figures are at a high resolution.
&#9679; If you have supplemental material, please read the following: Supplemental material can be divided into two types: appendices and non-readable supplemental material: <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9675;	Appendices are material that can be read, and include lemmas, formulas, proofs, and tables that are not critical to the reading and understanding of the paper. In your final camera-ready paper, appendices come after the references in the main paper (see the Springer templates). Appendices do not count towards the page limit. <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &#9675;	Non-readable supplemental material should follow the Springer templates. <br>
&#9679; The file (Camera Ready copy) must be in Portable Document Format (PDF) on A4 paper. <br>
&#9679; All figures and tables must be included directly in the paper in their final positions, and at a resolution that is both readable when printed or when viewed on an electronic device in PDF format.<br>
<br>
&#9679; Authors are required to send a zipped file, containing the following:
    <p> 1. 	Camera-ready paper in a pdf format. </p>
    <p> 2.	Camera-ready paper source file (Ms_Word or Latex). </p>
