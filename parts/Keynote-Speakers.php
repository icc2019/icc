								Abstract:</p>
							<p align="justify">
	 The revolution of big data simulation and big data analytics has empowered the high resolution of
         visualization and accurate decision making. The transformation trend of modelling and simulation,
         sequential and parallel algorithms, distributed and shared memory are required to achieve the
         information technology revolution in big data analytics. The trend of data simulation and model
         simulation-driven were focused on the independent and dependent parameters of the strong
         fundamental theory and methodology in data modelling and mathematical modelling. The use of
         complex modelling and machine learning technique for training a high-dimensional and integrated
         dataset can be obtained by the SIMD architecture of high performance computing system. Some
         applications highlight the indicators of the parallel performance measurement and big data analytics
         performance for investigating the high resolution of visualization and decision making. In conclusion, a
         variety of different analysis such as numerical analysis, parallel performance evaluation, visualizations,
         multi-dimensional graph, list of tables, and effective indicators are able to predict and interpret the
         decision making accurately.

								Realizing Edge Marketplaces

								Abstract:</p>
							<p align="justify">

Research in the Internet of Things (IoT) conceives a world where everyday objects are connected to the
Internet and exchange, store, process, and collect data from the surrounding environment. IoT devices
are becoming essential for supporting the delivery of data to enable electronic services, but they are not
sufficient in most cases to host application services directly due to their intrinsic resource constraints.
Edge (or Fog) computing can be a suitable paradigm to overcome these limitations, as it can coexist and
cooperate with centralized Cloud systems and extends the latter toward the network edge. In this way,
it is possible to distribute resources and services of computing, storage, and networking along the Cloud-
to-Things continuum. 
The edge of the network therefore has the potential to host services for supporting a variety of user
applications, ranging in complexity from data preprocessing, image and video rendering, and interactive
gaming, to embedded systems in autonomous cars and built environments. However, the computational
and data resources over which such services are hosted, and the actors that interact with these services,
have an intermittent availability and access profile, introducing significant risk for user applications that
must rely on them. This talk will describe the development of an edge marketplace, which is able to
support multiple providers for offering services at the network edge, and to enable demand supply for
influencing the operation of such a marketplace. Resilience, cost, and quality of service and experience
will subsequently enable such a marketplace to adapt its services over time. This talk will also describes
how distributed-ledger technologies (such as blockchains) provide a promising approach to support the
operation of such a marketplace and regulate its behavior (such as the GDPR in Europe) and operation.
Application scenarios provide context for the discussion of how such a marketplace would function and
be utilized in practice. The talk suggests potential edge services that can be hosted in cities in the Middle
East (such as Riyadh), and business models to support these services.

Cybersecurity Challenges and Solutions in Hyper-Connected 5G-based IoT Ecosystem

								Abstract:</p>
							<p align="justify">

Due to the modern technological advancements and innovations, computers are not just limited to
the desktop, laptop or portable devices, but they are proliferating into various areas of our lives and
blurring the lines between reality and fiction. This fact is becoming truth due to the emergence of
Internet of Things (IoT), which unites physical and virtual worlds by extending computing and
connectivity capabilities to everyday things e.g. cars, refrigerators, and home appliances, etc. IoT is
ushering in a new era which is transforming the way we work, live, communicate and perform
businesses. The dawn of fifth generation networks (5G) with the promise of ultra-high speed,
massive bandwidth, and super-low latency is the building block of making this all happen with more
IoT friendly ecosystem and its applications in automotive, healthcare, energy, aerospace &amp; defense,
industrial, and consumer electronics products, etc. However, this unprecedented dependence and
increased connectivity of billions of connected IoT devices could lead to unexpected cybersecurity
risks and threats, which may have serious ramifications beyond our imagination. In this speech, we
would dissect cybersecurity challenges and concerns in the 5G connected IoT-enabled world.
Furthermore, we would explore some peculiar problems inherent in 5G and IoT ecosystem, which
could exacerbate the risks of cybersecurity breaches, crimes, and attacks. Finally, we would discuss
some of our research contributions as well as future trends in this domain.
